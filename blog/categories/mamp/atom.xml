    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'd like to use my first post to describe how I set up new projects in a simple way that works best for me. My setup is pretty straight-forward, really. I know some people who mess about with include-paths so they can run multiple <em>apps</em> on one cake-install, but since I work for various clients and even more various projects I like my project folders to be self-contained.</p>

<h2>Downloading CakePHP</h2>

<p>Easy enough. Grab a fresh copy of <a href="https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/downloads">CakePHP @ Github</a></p>

<p>Unzip the package and copy the extracted folder to your Sites directory (mine is in /Users/Hyra/Sites) and rename the folder to the project you want to work on. For example: www.fantasticnewsite.org</p>

<h2>Setting up CakePHP</h2>

<p>I won't go through the all of the options as it's perfectly documented <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/#!/view/912/Installation" title="The Manual :: 1.3 Collection">here at the CakePHP Book</a> but what I usually do is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rename /app/config/database.php.default to /app/config/database.php and fill in the database credentials in $default</li>
<li><p>Open up the Terminal and run (for example):</p>

<p>chmod 777 ~/Sites/www.fantasticnewsite.org/app/tmp</p></li>
<li><p>Open up /app/config/core.php and change the values for:</p>

<p>Security.salt</p>

<p>Security.cipherSeed</p></li>
</ol>


<p>That's it really. Of course, there's a bunch of extra stuff you can set up, but that's all outlined <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/#!/view/915/Advanced-Installation" title="The Manual :: 1.3 Collection">here</a> if you want to read up on it.</p>

<h2>Setting up MAMP Pro</h2>

<p>Optional. If you have any form of AMP setup already running, by all means, skip this step. I just happen to run MAMP Pro for ease and comfort.</p>

<p>Open up MAMP Pro and go to the Hosts tab and simply:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hit the plus-sign</li>
<li>Give the site a name at which you want to access it locally</li>
<li>Browse to the location you want the site to be located</li>
<li>Hit apply</li>
</ol>


<p>By this point you should be able to point your <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Mozilla | Firefox web browser &amp; Thunderbird email client">favourite browser</a> to your fresh local domain at http://www.fantasticnewsite.org</p>
