<p>Below is a screenshot of what an <a href="/customize-the-terminal/">average terminal</a> looks like when you just use</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">$</span> <span class="nx">cat</span> <span class="nx">somefile</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">js</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/screenshots/130806_terminal_dull.png" alt="Terminal Dull Colours" title="Terminal Dull Colours"></p>
<p>Sure, it does the job, and you probably are ok with it looking dull as hell. But what if you could make it look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/screenshots/130806_terminal_colour.png" alt="Terminal Colour" title="Terminal Colour"></p>
<p>Indeed! If you could, why wouldn&#39;t you?</p>
<h2><a name="the-ingredients" class="anchor" href="#the-ingredients"><span class="header-link"></span></a>The ingredients</h2>
<p>So, let&#39;s get to it. Luckily this isn&#39;t very complex to get going on your machine. Let&#39;s start by installing <a href="https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb">Pygments</a>. This little Ruby wrapper library is used to make the realtime syntax highlighting possible:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">gem</span> <span class="nx">install</span> <span class="nx">pygments</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Next up, the alias itself. Depending on your shell and environment open up your profile. If you aren&#39;t sure whether you&#39;ve installed or configured something specifically on your system, chances are the file you are looking for (on OSX at least) is <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>In there, add the following alias:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">alias</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;pygmentize -O style=monokai -f console256 -g&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s all there is to it. Now whenever you type <code>c some-file.ext</code> it will detect the extension and add syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I chose the monokai style because it looks awesome and works well with the rest of my ZSH theme, but feel free to try a few and see which works best for you.</p>
<p>Happy CLI-ing!</p>

Writing this post in vim. Macvim to be exact. Trying not to touch the arrow keys, not use the h-j-k-l too extensively either, work with A and I a lot, and generally trying not to cock things up too much by hitting the wrong commands.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>So why do I willingly put myself through the torture of using the monster that is Vim? Well, just like a lot of developers out there, I&#39;ve had a long time desire to be able to use Vim properly. No immediate need, just a personal goal if you will. I&#39;ve tried Vim a couple of times over the last few months, but pretty much every attempt lead quickly to being overwhelmed by all the different commands and feeling about a gazillion times slower as I did when using Sublime Text Edit 2.</p>
<h3><a name="new-tactic" class="anchor" href="#new-tactic"><span class="header-link"></span></a>New tactic</h3>
<p>The new plan is not as exciting or brilliant as one might hope, but it&#39;s one that might just work: <em>Forceful editing</em>
What? Well, it&#39;s simple really .. whenever I was trying out Vim and found myself having to actually &quot;quickly&quot; edit a file or whip up some code I switched to my trustworthy Sublime. This time around I&#39;m going to force myself to stay in Vim. This will slow me down at first. A lot. And it will probably lead to some cursing and frustration. But I guess it&#39;s the only way to learn.</p>
<p>So here we go, I&#39;ve written this post in Vim, the keyboard is still intact, I haven&#39;t cursed and screamed more than usual, so I suppose we&#39;re off to a good start.</p>
<p>As a bonus I&#39;ve decided I&#39;ll keep you guys informed of my progress and share my findings, tips and useful plugins I might stumble upon whilst enduring this ordeal :)</p>
<p>If any of you are already using Vim and have some tips or tricks, let us know!</p>
<p>For now all that&#39;s left is to save, commit and push this file .. all from within Vim!</p>
<p>I like.</p>
