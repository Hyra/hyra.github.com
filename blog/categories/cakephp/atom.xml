    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently started creating a RESTful API in CakePHP to work with a Knockout.js frontend.</p>

<p>While Knockout.js is a lot of fun, it does expect your JSON to be in a certain format.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Take the following response from a simple <code>find</code> action:</p>

<pre><code>"Projects": [
    {
        "Project": {
            "id": "151",
            "title": "Een ander project",
            "slug": "een-ander-project",
            "description": "dsfdsfs",
            "tasks_count": "2",
            "tasks_backlog": "2",
            "tasks_open": "0",
            "tasks_closed": "0",
            "duedate": "2012-04-09",
            "created": "2012-04-09 13:52:19",
            "modified": "2012-04-09 13:52:19"
        },
        "Task": [ ]
    },
    {
        "Project": {
            "id": "152",
            "title": "Een ander project",
            "slug": "een-ander-project-1",
            "description": "dsfdsfs",
            "tasks_count": null,
            "tasks_backlog": null,
            "tasks_open": null,
            "tasks_closed": null,
            "duedate": "2012-04-09",
            "created": "2012-04-09 13:55:30",
            "modified": "2012-04-09 13:55:30"
        },
        "Task": [ ]
    },
</code></pre>

<p>This is fine to work with in your typical View, but Knockout rather has a nested format, and doesn't like the leading <code>Project</code> nodes. You could write custom parsers in Knockout, but would quickly become a hell to maintain.</p>

<p>Instead, I wrote a little function to reformat the response to get the result Knockout likes:</p>

<pre><code>public function formatResponse($data) {
    $ret = array();
    foreach($data as $key) {
        $keys = array_keys($key);
        $t = $key[$keys[0]];
        for($i=1; $i&lt;count($keys); $i++) {
            $t[Inflector::pluralize(strtolower($keys[$i]))] = $key[$keys[$i]];
        }
        $ret[] = $t;
    }

    return $ret;
}

$projects = $this-&gt;Project-&gt;find('all');
$projects = $this-&gt;formatResponse($projects);
$this-&gt;set(compact('projects'));
$this-&gt;set('_serialize', array('projects'));
</code></pre>

<p>This will reformat the Projects response to:</p>

<pre><code>"projects": [
    {
        "id": "151",
        "title": "Een ander project",
        "slug": "een-ander-project",
        "description": "dsfdsfs",
        "tasks_count": "2",
        "tasks_backlog": "2",
        "tasks_open": "0",
        "tasks_closed": "0",
        "duedate": "2012-04-09",
        "created": "2012-04-09 13:52:19",
        "modified": "2012-04-09 13:52:19",
        "tasks": [ ]
    },
    {
        "id": "152",
        "title": "Een ander project",
        "slug": "een-ander-project-1",
        "description": "dsfdsfs",
        "tasks_count": null,
        "tasks_backlog": null,
        "tasks_open": null,
        "tasks_closed": null,
        "duedate": "2012-04-09",
        "created": "2012-04-09 13:55:30",
        "modified": "2012-04-09 13:55:30",
        "tasks": [ ]
    },
</code></pre>

<p>This way I don't have to worry about modifying the core of how Knockout.js works with JSON, and focus on developing the front-end of my app instead.</p>

<p>It will probably be classier to put the function in something like an <code>afterFind</code>, but for now it will do nicely.</p>

    <updated>2012-02-24T11:43:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mindthecode.com/using-sessions-in-phpunit-tests-with-cakephp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was breaking my head over failing unit tests when trying to test a simple Controller that was saving a new record.</p>

<p>Turned out it was failing only on the command line, while the webversion was passing all the tests.</p>

<p>Luckily, the solution was simple ..</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The PHPUnit command line suite apparently outputs contents early, before the session gets initiated.</p>

<h2>Solution 1</h2>

<p>Add --stderr to the command line:</p>

<pre><code>cake testsuite app Controller/YourFancyController --stderr
</code></pre>

<p>This will pass the tests again, as it doesn't output contents early to <code>STDOUT</code>. The only "problem" is you won't see the awesome green and red colors in the CLI output anymore.</p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>

<p>This is the one I use, as it brings the colors back.</p>

<p>As I'm using my self-contained PHPUnit Install, as found on Github @ <a href="https://github.com/hyra/PHPUnit-Cake2">PHPUnit-Cake2</a> I am able to edit the following file: <code>Vendor/PHPUnit/Autoload.php</code> At the very top of this file, initialize the session early:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
</code></pre>

<p>This will pass the tests again, and even better, bring back the colors!</p>

<p>Maybe the session initialization can be done early by putting it in a file by CakePHP itself, but haven't found the right place yet. Any suggestions?</p>

    <link href="http://mindthecode.com/loading-external-files-in-php-the-better-way/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-06T19:37:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mindthecode.com/loading-external-files-in-php-the-better-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you run into "weird behavior" when using <code>file_get_contents</code> in your code when retrieving external data. I noticed this for instance when accessing the Facebook Graph API the other day. When using file_get_contents the results were so much different than when using cUrl.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Sometimes even, it is disabled on your host for security reasons. So i'm making it a habbit to run everything through cUrl instead. Not just to get the "actual results", but also since it's a lot faster.</p>

<h2>Faster you say?</h2>

<p>Indeed! Take this benchmark for instance, <code>file_get_contents</code> vs <code>curl</code> on google.com:</p>

<pre><code>[1] =&gt; Array   // 1 request to google.com
(
    [FGC] =&gt;  0.4955058 // 38.88% slower
    [CURL] =&gt; 0.3582108
)
[5] =&gt; Array   // 5 requests to google.com
(
    [FGC] =&gt;  2.2415568 // 24.44% slower
    [CURL] =&gt; 1.7973249
)    
[10] =&gt; Array  // 10 requests to google.com
(
    [FGC] =&gt;  4.7877922 // 29.46% slower
    [CURL] =&gt; 3.6951289
)    
[25] =&gt; Array  // 25 requests to google.com
(
    [FGC] =&gt;  10.932404 // 10.18% slower
    [CURL] =&gt; 9.9168329
)    
[50] =&gt; Array  // 50 requests to google.com
(
    [FGC] =&gt;  22.535982 // 24.74% slower
    [CURL] =&gt; 18.068931
)    
[100] =&gt; Array // 100 requests to google.com
(
    [FGC] =&gt;  44.685283 // 18.57% slower
    [CURL] =&gt; 37.688820
)
</code></pre>

<p>Sure, it might not seem that big a difference. But imagine loading an external file being a big part of your (heavily) used application.</p>

<h2>Got an example ?</h2>

<p>Sure, no worries. Rather than calling:</p>

<pre><code>$data = file_get_contents('http://whatever.com/sheep.jpg');
</code></pre>

<p>you could do:</p>

<pre><code>function loadFile($url) {
    $ch = curl_init();

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);

    $data = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);

    return $data;
}

$data = loadFile('http://whatever.com/sheep.jpg');
</code></pre>

<p>And you're done.</p>

<h2>Thoughts?</h2>

<p>Anyone else experiencing different results between cUrl and the builtin function? I've been googling what could cause this, but so far nothing conclusive.</p>
