    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markdown rocks. I lately fell in love with it when I was setting up this very blog. You can just write easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text files, and Markdown takes care of the rest.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>For this blog I had used a Markdown script I found that parses plain text and outputs it as HTML. It allows me to write posts in a simple/plain format and just pump it into the database <code>as is</code>. For a while I wanted to make it into a more solid CakePHP Helper. And today I did. Setting it up couldn't be simpler, and using it is a matter of adding it as a call in your views.</p>

<p>I put it on Github @ <a href="https://github.com/Hyra/markdown" title="CakePHP Markdown Github">Markdown for CakePHP</a> along with the necessary instructions and usage example.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy it, and if you have any suggestions or tips, don't hesitate to leave a comment or Fork it.</p>
